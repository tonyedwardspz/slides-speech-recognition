    I started playing around with speech recognition about 4 years ago when I was studying about it for my Masters degree and was quite intrigued by how hard is the problem it solves -- all the various factors like accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed influence it.

    In practice, speech looks a lot like this:

    Little did I know when researching this at Mozilla, at around the same time, a team from Google were writing a spec for Web Speech APIs.

    defining JavaScript APIs that would allow developers to incorporate speech recognition into their web pages. About a year later, with Chrome v25, Web Speech APIs were out.

    Whereas Chrome had speech input capabilities with x-webkit-speech attribute (now deprecated) to input fields since v11.

    Ok, so let’s see how these APIs look like in practice
