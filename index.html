     Speech Recognigion has been around for decades (early 1950s) but because it is such a HARD problem (just think of
     all the factors that play into it: accent, pronunciation, pitch, volume, and speed) it was mainly targetting
     highly specialized domains:<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;- speaker dependent: involves a training step where a user is asked to read some sentences -> fine tune<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;- command based/limited vocab: e.g. call routing, digit recognition<br>
     But then, technology caught up and starting with Apple's Siri in 2011 a wave a voice-enabled devices/personal

    Well, speech recognition got very GOOD these days -- in terms of numbers (and I'll explain these in a bit)
    Google managed to improve their own speech recognizer's error rate from a 23% to 4.9% in a handful of years and
    Baidu has currently knocked that out of the park with a 3.7% error rate achieved by its Deep Speech 2 system.

    If you are wondering what this error rate actually means: it is the sum of all errors the system produces over
    the size of the reference speech. These errors can be Insertions, Substitutions and Deletions.
    <br><br>
    Then sure, you might say nice numbers and math, but what does that mean?
    It turns out speech recognition systems are so good that they can even beat humans to it.
    And there's research to prove it -- a group from Stanford proved that
